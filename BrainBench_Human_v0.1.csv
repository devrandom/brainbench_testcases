https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2043-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context). How does the brain's functional architecture enable sensory and mnemonic representations to closely interface while also avoiding sensory-mnemonic interference? Here, we asked this question using first-person, head-mounted virtual reality and fMRI. Using virtual reality, human participants of both sexes learned a set of immersive, real-world visuospatial environments in which we systematically manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions, spanning from a single FOV to a city street. We used individualized, within-subject fMRI to determine which brain areas support memory of the visuospatial context associated with a scene during recall (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2). Across the whole brain, activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context, each located immediately anterior to one of the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex. Individual subject analyses revealed that these anterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas, which selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places. In addition to showing activity levels that were modulated by the amount of visuospatial context, multivariate analyses showed that these anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled. Together, these results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of the local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.","To fluidly engage with the world, our brains must simultaneously represent both the scene in front of us and our memory of the immediate surrounding environment (i.e., local visuospatial context).

A previous study revealed that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)-parabrachial nucleus (PBN) pathway is involved in pain regulation. The same pathway might also control itch. To test this possibility, prodynorphin (Pdyn)-Cre mice were used to optogenetically manipulate Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections. We found that optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ amygdala neurons or Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections inhibited histamine-evoked and chloroquine-evoked scratching. The number of Fos-positive neurons in the PBN increased following intradermal injection of chloroquine. Optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections suppressed the increase in Fos expression in the PBN. Optogenetic stimulation of Pdyn+ CeA-to-PBN projections increased thermal and mechanical thresholds without affecting anxiety-like behavior. These results highlight the importance of dynorphinergic projections from the central amygdala to the parabrachial nucleus in the regulation of itch signaling.","The amygdala plays a key role in the processing of itch and pain signals as well as emotion.

To address this, we performed single nucleus RNAseq on tissue from 32 human AD and non-AD donors (19 female, 13 male) each with five cortical regions: entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, visual association cortex, and primary visual cortex. Analysis of 51,586 endothelial cells revealed unique gene expression patterns across the five regions in non-AD donors. Alzheimer's brain endothelial cells were characterized by upregulated protein folding genes and distinct transcriptomic differences in response to amyloid β plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This dataset demonstrates previously unrecognized regional heterogeneity in the endothelial cell transcriptome in both aged non-AD and AD brain.","Vascular endothelial cells play an important role in maintaining brain health, but their contribution to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is obscured by limited understanding of the cellular heterogeneity in normal aged brain and in disease.

Herweg et al. (2020) suggest that decreases in memory-related broadband power mask narrowband theta increases. Their survey also notes that the theta oscillations appear most prominently in contrasts that isolate memory retrieval processes and when aggregating signals across large brain regions. We evaluate these hypotheses by analyzing human hippocampal recordings captured as 162 neurosurgical patients (n = 86 female) performed a free recall task. Using the Irregular-Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis (IRASA) to separate broad and narrowband components of the field potential, we show that (1) broadband and narrowband components of theta exhibit opposite effects, with broadband signals decreasing and narrowband theta increasing during successful encoding; (2) whereas low-frequency theta oscillations increase before successful recall, higher-frequency theta and alpha oscillations decrease, masking the positive effect of theta when aggregating across the full band; and (3) the effects of theta on memory encoding and retrieval do not differ between reference schemes that accentuate local signals (bipolar) and those that aggregate signals globally (whole-brain average). In line with computational models that ascribe a fundamental role for hippocampal theta in memory, our large-scale study of human hippocampal recordings shows that 3–4 Hz theta oscillations reliably increase during successful memory encoding and before spontaneous recall of previously studied items.","Computational models of rodent physiology implicate hippocampal theta as a key modulator of learning and memory (Buzsáki and Moser, 2013; Lisman and Jensen, 2013), yet human hippocampal recordings have shown divergent theta correlates of memory formation.

However, motion is another cue that could be used by the visual system to classify objects. To determine how motion-defined object category information is processed by the brain in the absence of luminance-defined form information, we created a novel stimulus set of “object kinematograms” to isolate motion-defined signals from other sources of visual information. Object kinematograms were generated by extracting motion information from videos of 6 object categories and applying the motion to limited-lifetime random dot patterns. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (n = 15, 40% women), we investigated whether category information from the object kinematograms could be decoded within the occipitotemporal and parietal cortex and evaluated whether the information overlapped with category responses to static images from the original videos. We decoded object category for both stimulus formats in all higher-order regions of interest (ROIs). More posterior occipitotemporal and ventral regions showed higher accuracy in the static condition, while more anterior occipitotemporal and dorsal regions showed higher accuracy in the dynamic condition. Further, decoding across the two stimulus formats was possible in all regions. These results demonstrate that motion cues can elicit widespread and robust category responses on par with those elicited by static luminance cues, even in ventral regions of visual cortex that have traditionally been associated with primarily image-defined form processing.","Humans can label and categorize objects in a visual scene with high accuracy and speed, a capacity well characterized with studies using static images.

However, no preclinical studies have examined the neurobiology underlying this phenomenon. To assess this, in vivo electrophysiology was used in Long Evans male and female rats during a DT task to record neural activity in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), a brain region implicated in drug-seeking. Rats were first assessed for DT, defined as the amount of time elapsed before rats quit seeking reward in an increasingly difficult operant task. Subsequently, rats underwent 2 weeks of self-administration for either water/saline or cocaine for 6 h/day. Animals then began a 1 month period of experimenter-imposed abstinence to induce heightened drug-seeking behavior. On day 28 of abstinence, DT and neural activity were reassessed; and on day 30, cocaine-seeking behavior was examined under extinction. Males had significantly higher DT than females and exhibited significantly more phasic PrL activity during the DT task. Furthermore, in male rats with a history of cocaine, PrL activity shifted to track DT; and this change in activity significantly correlated with the change in DT. Additionally, male (but not female) rats with low DT after 28 d of abstinence had significantly heightened drug-seeking behavior. Finally, PrL activity during the DT task predicted cocaine-seeking behavior. Collectively, these data demonstrate an important role for the PrL in DT in males, and link this neural activity and behavior to drug-seeking, particularly in males.","Distress tolerance (DT) is defined as the ability to persist in challenging goal-directed behavior in the face of stress, and individuals with low DT exhibit heightened drug-seeking behavior.

Quantifying the cost of this control is essential as it reveals how the brain can be controlled based on the minimization of the control cost, and which brain regions are most important to the optimal control of transitions. Despite its great potential, the current control paradigm in neuroscience uses a deterministic framework and is therefore unable to consider stochasticity, severely limiting its application to neural data. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a novel framework for the evaluation of control costs based on a linear stochastic model. Following our previous work, we quantified the optimal control cost as the minimal Kullback-Leibler divergence between the uncontrolled and controlled processes. In the linear model, we established an analytical expression for minimal cost and showed that we can decompose it into the cost for controlling the mean and covariance of brain activity. To evaluate the utility of our novel framework, we examined the significant brain regions in the optimal control of transitions from the resting state to seven cognitive task states in human whole-brain imaging data of either sex. We found that, in realizing the different transitions, the lower visual areas commonly played a significant role in controlling the means, while the posterior cingulate cortex commonly played a significant role in controlling the covariances.","The brain is a system that performs numerous functions by controlling its states.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0148-22.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using fMRI, fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and impairment following focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Center for Ageing and Neuroscience data, a large, population-based cohort of healthy males and females across the adult lifespan. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localize the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodeled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of nonphysical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.","Fluid intelligence, the ability to solve novel, complex problems, declines steeply during healthy human aging.

The neutral information was the association that forms between an auditory stimulus and a visual stimulus (labeled S2 and S1) across their pairings in sensory preconditioning. We show that, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the danger shifts consolidation of the S2-S1 association from the PRh to the BLA; and does so by interacting with processes involved in encoding of the S2-S1 pairings. Specifically, we show that the initial S2-S1 pairing in sensory preconditioning is encoded in the BLA and not the PRh; whereas the later S2-S1 pairings are encoded in the PRh and not the BLA. When the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a context alone exposure, the BLA-dependent trace of the early S2-S1 pairings decays and the PRh-dependent trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is consolidated in memory. However, when the sensory preconditioning session is followed by a shocked context exposure, the PRh-dependent trace of the later S2-S1 pairings is suppressed and the BLA-dependent trace of the initial S2-S1 pairing is consolidated in memory.

The tractography results indicated that thalamic connection to the frontal cortex developed later than the other thalamocortical connections (parieto-occipital, motor, somatosensory, and temporal). Using a connectivity-based segmentation strategy, we revealed that functional partitions of thalamic subdivisions were formed at 32 PMWs or earlier, and the partition developed toward the adult pattern in a lateral-to-medial pattern. Collectively, these findings revealed faster development of the lateral thalamus than the central part as well as a posterior-to-anterior developmental gradient of thalamocortical connectivity from the third trimester to early infancy.","Thalamus is a critical component of the limbic system that is extensively involved in both basic and high-order brain functions.

In nature, stimuli lighter or darker than their local surround have different spatial properties and contrast distributions (Ratliff et al., 2010; Cooper and Norcia, 2015; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021). Similarly, in human vision, we show that luminance contrast affects the perception of lights and darks differently. At high contrast, human subjects of both sexes locate dark stimuli faster and more accurately than light stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the OFF pathway. However, at low contrast, they locate light stimuli faster and more accurately than dark stimuli, which is consistent with a visual system dominated by the ON pathway. Luminance contrast was strongly correlated with multiple ON/OFF dominance ratios estimated from light/dark ratios of performance errors, missed targets, or reaction times (RTs). All correlations could be demonstrated at multiple eccentricities of the central visual field with an ON-OFF perimetry test implemented in a head-mounted visual display. We conclude that high-contrast stimuli are processed faster and more accurately by OFF pathways than ON pathways. However, the OFF dominance shifts toward ON dominance when stimulus contrast decreases, as expected from the higher-contrast sensitivity of ON cortical pathways (Kremkow et al., 2014; Rahimi-Nasrabadi et al., 2021).

They may not only inherit acoustic rhythms, but might also impose endogenous rhythms onto processing. In support of this, we here report that human (both male and female) eye movements during naturalistic reading exhibit rhythmic patterns that show frequency-selective coherence with the EEG, in the absence of any stimulation rhythm. Periodicity was observed in two distinct frequency bands: First, word-locked saccades at 4-5 Hz display coherence with whole-head theta-band activity. Second, fixation durations fluctuate rhythmically at ∼1 Hz, in coherence with occipital delta-band activity. This latter effect was additionally phase-locked to sentence endings, suggesting a relationship with the formation of multi-word chunks. Together, eye movements during reading contain rhythmic patterns that occur in synchrony with oscillatory brain activity. This suggests that linguistic processing imposes preferred processing time scales onto reading, largely independent of actual physical rhythms in the stimulus.","Neural oscillations are thought to support speech and language processing.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1966-21.2022,Behavioral/Cognitive,"Sleep facilitates abstraction, but the exact mechanisms underpinning this are unknown. Here, we aimed to determine whether triggering reactivation in sleep could facilitate this process. We paired abstraction problems with sounds, then replayed these during either slow-wave sleep (SWS) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to trigger memory reactivation in 27 human participants (19 female). This revealed performance improvements on abstraction problems that were cued in REM, but not problems cued in SWS. Interestingly, the cue-related improvement was not significant until a follow-up retest 1 week after the manipulation, suggesting that REM may initiate a sequence of plasticity events that requires more time to be implemented. Furthermore, memory-linked trigger sounds evoked distinct neural responses in REM, but not SWS. Overall, our findings suggest that targeted memory reactivation in REM can facilitate visual rule abstraction, although this effect takes time to unfold.","Sleep facilitates abstraction, but the exact mechanisms underpinning this are unknown. Here, we aimed to determine whether triggering reactivation in sleep could facilitate this process. We paired abstraction problems with sounds, then replayed these during either slow-wave sleep (SWS) or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep to trigger memory reactivation in 27 human participants (19 female).

Midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for reinforcement, and their activation is sufficient for learning about cues, actions, and outcomes. Here we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying the ability of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) dopamine neurons to support instrumental learning. By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations in male and female rats, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes. VTA dopamine neurons imbue actions and their associated cues with motivational value that allows flexible and persistent pursuit, whereas SNc dopamine neurons support time-limited, precise, action-specific learning that is nonscalable and inflexible. This architecture is reminiscent of actor–critic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous dopamine systems support unique forms of instrumental learning that ultimately result in disparate reward-seeking strategies.","Reward seeking requires the coordination of motor programs to achieve goals.

We monitored these variables while the mice were awake, during periods of rapid eye movement (REM), and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Pupil diameter was smaller during sleep than in the awake state. Changes in pupil diameter were coherent with both gamma-band power and blood volume in the somatosensory cortex, but the strength and sign of this relationship varied with arousal state. We observed a strong negative correlation between pupil diameter and both gamma-band power and blood volume during periods of awake rest and NREM sleep, although the correlations between pupil diameter and these signals became positive during periods of alertness, active whisking, and REM. Blinking was associated with increases in arousal and decreases in blood volume when the mouse was asleep. Bilateral coherence in gamma-band power and in blood volume dropped following awake blinking, indicating a reset of neural and vascular activity. Using only eye metrics (pupil diameter and eye motion), we could determine the arousal state of the mouse ('Awake,' 'NREM,' 'REM') with >90% accuracy with a 5 s resolution. There is a strong relationship between pupil diameter and hemodynamics signals in mice, reflecting the pronounced effects of arousal on cerebrovascular dynamics.","Arousal state affects neural activity and vascular dynamics in the cortex, with sleep associated with large changes in the local field potential and increases in cortical blood flow.

Here, we compared the respiration entrainment of mouse PFC local field potential and spiking activity (23 male and 2 female mice) across distinct behavioral states: during awake immobility in the home cage (HC), during passive coping in response to inescapable stress under tail suspension (TS), and during reward consumption (Rew). Respiration-driven rhythms emerged during all three states. However, prefrontal γ oscillations were more strongly entrained by respiration during HC than TS or Rew. Moreover, neuronal spikes of putative pyramidal cells and putative interneurons showed significant respiration phase-coupling throughout behaviors with characteristic phase preferences depending on the behavioral state. Finally, while phase-coupling dominated in deep layers in HC and Rew conditions, TS resulted in the recruitment of superficial layer neurons to respiration. These results jointly suggest that respiration dynamically entrains prefrontal neuronal activity depending on the behavioral state.","Respiration-rhythmic oscillations in the local field potential emerge in the mPFC, a cortical region with a key role in the regulation of cognitive and emotional behavior.

We probed the functional connectivity between human area V6A (hV6A) and the primary motor cortex (M1) using dual-site, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation with a short (4 ms) and a longer (10 ms) interstimulus interval while healthy participants (18 men and 18 women) planned a visually-guided or a memory-guided reaching movement toward positions located at different depths and directions. We found that, when the stimulation over hV6A is sent 4 ms before the stimulation over M1, hV6A inhibits motor-evoked potentials during planning of either rightward or leftward reaching movements. No modulations were found when the stimulation over hV6A was sent 10 ms before the stimulation over M1, suggesting that only short medial parieto-frontal routes are active during reach planning. Moreover, the short route of hV6A–premotor cortex–M1 is active during reach planning irrespectively of the nature (visual or memory) of the reaching target.

Perplexingly, anatomy studies imply that corticofugal axons primarily target glutamatergic IC neurons while only sparsely innervating IC GABA neurons. Corticofugal inhibition of the IC may thus occur largely independently of feedforward activation of local GABA neurons. We shed light on this paradox using in vitro electrophysiology in acute IC slices from fluorescent reporter mice of either sex. Using optogenetic stimulation of corticofugal axons, we find that excitation evoked with single light flashes is indeed stronger in presumptive glutamatergic neurons compared with GABAergic neurons. However, many IC GABA neurons fire tonically at rest, such that sparse and weak excitation suffices to significantly increase their spike rates. Furthermore, a subset of glutamatergic IC neurons fire spikes during repetitive corticofugal activity, leading to polysynaptic excitation in IC GABA neurons owing to a dense intracollicular connectivity. Consequently, recurrent excitation amplifies corticofugal activity, drives spikes in IC GABA neurons, and generates substantial local inhibition in the IC.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0815-23.2023,Cellular/Molecular,"Neurotransmission is shaped by extracellular pH. Alkalization enhances pH-sensitive transmitter release and receptor activation, whereas acidification inhibits these processes and can activate acid-sensitive conductances in the synaptic cleft. Previous work has shown that the synaptic cleft can either acidify because of synaptic vesicular release and/or alkalize because of Ca2+ extrusion by the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA). The direction of change differs across synapse types. At the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the direction and magnitude of pH transients in the synaptic cleft during transmission remain ambiguous. We set out to elucidate the extracellular pH transients that occur at this cholinergic synapse under near-physiological conditions and identify their sources. We monitored pH-dependent changes in the synaptic cleft of the mouse levator auris longus using viral expression of the pseudoratiometric probe pHusion-Ex in the muscle. Using mice from both sexes, a significant and prolonged alkalization occurred when stimulating the connected nerve for 5 s at 50 Hz, which was dependent on postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. Sustained stimulation for a longer duration (20 s at 50 Hz) caused additional prolonged net acidification at the cleft. To investigate the mechanism underlying cleft alkalization, we used muscle-expressed GCaMP3 to monitor the contribution of postsynaptic Ca2+. Activity-induced liberation of intracellular Ca2+ in muscle positively correlated with alkalization of the synaptic cleft, whereas inhibiting PMCA significantly decreased the extent of cleft alkalization. Thus, cholinergic synapses of the mouse NMJ typically alkalize because of cytosolic Ca2+ liberated in muscle during activity, unless under highly strenuous conditions where acidification predominates.","Neurotransmission is shaped by extracellular pH. Alkalization enhances pH-sensitive transmitter release and receptor activation, whereas acidification inhibits these processes and can activate acid-sensitive conductances in the synaptic cleft. Previous work has shown that the synaptic cleft can either acidify because of synaptic vesicular release and/or alkalize because of Ca2+ extrusion by the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA). The direction of change differs across synapse types. At the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the direction and magnitude of pH transients in the synaptic cleft during transmission remain ambiguous. We set out to elucidate the extracellular pH transients that occur at this glutamatergic synapse under near-physiological conditions and identify their sources. We monitored pH-dependent changes in the synaptic cleft of the mouse levator auris longus using viral expression of the pseudoratiometric probe pHusion-Ex in the muscle. Using mice from both sexes, a significant reduction of alkalization occurred when stimulating the connected nerve for 5 s at 50 Hz, which was dependent on postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ release. Sustained stimulation for a longer duration (20 s at 50 Hz) caused additional prolonged net acidification at the cleft. To investigate the mechanism underlying cleft alkalization, we used muscle-expressed GCaMP3 to monitor the contribution of postsynaptic Ca2+. Activity-induced liberation of intracellular Ca2+ in muscle positively correlated with alkalization of the synaptic cleft, whereas inhibiting PMCA significantly decreased the extent of cleft alkalization.

To elucidate the mechanisms and downstream pathways affected by activated integrin expression and central regeneration, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of adult male rat DRG sensory neurons transduced with α9k1, and controls, with and without axotomy of the central branch. Expression of α9k1 without the central axotomy led to upregulation of a known PNS regeneration program, including many genes associated with peripheral nerve regeneration.

HD pathophysiology involves evident impairment in glutamatergic neurotransmission leading to severe striatal neurodegeneration. The vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGLUT3) regulates the striatal network that is centrally affected by HD. Nevertheless, current evidence on the role of VGLUT3 in HD pathophysiology is lacking. Here, we crossed mice lacking Slc17a8 gene (VGLUT3–/–) with heterozygous zQ175 knock-in mouse model of HD (zQ175:VGLUT3–/–). Longitudinal assessment of motor and cognitive functions from 6 to 15 months of age reveals that VGLUT3 deletion rescues motor coordination and short-term memory deficits in both male and female zQ175 mice. VGLUT3 deletion also rescues neuronal loss likely via the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in the striatum of zQ175 mice of both sexes. Interestingly, the rescue in neuronal survival in zQ175:VGLUT3–/– mice is accompanied by a reduction in the number of nuclear mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates with no change in the total aggregate levels or microgliosis. Collectively, these findings provide novel evidence that VGLUT3, despite its limited expression, can be a vital contributor to HD pathophysiology and a viable target for HD therapeutics.","Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive motor and cognitive impairments, with no disease-modifying therapies yet available.

Excessive salience attribution to drug over nondrug cues/reinforcers, with concomitant inhibitory control decreases, are common mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Although inhibitory control alterations generally culminate in prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivations across drugs of abuse, patterns in individuals with heroin addiction (iHUDs) remain unknown. We used a stop-signal fMRI task designed to meet recent consensus guidelines in mapping inhibitory control in 41 iHUDs and 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). Despite group similarities in the stop-signal response time (SSRT; the classic inhibitory control measure), compared with HCs, iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity (proportion of hits in go vs false alarms in stop trials; p = 0.003). Additionally, iHUDs exhibited lower right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) activity during successful versus failed stops (the hallmark inhibitory control contrast). Lower left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with slower SSRT specifically in iHUDs and lower left aPFC activity with worse target sensitivity across all participants (p < 0.05 corrected). Importantly, in iHUDs, lower left SMA and aPFC activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last use and higher severity of dependence, respectively (p < 0.05 corrected). Together, results revealed lower perceptual sensitivity and hypoactivations during inhibitory control in cognitive control regions (e.g., aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) as associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures in iHUDs. Such neurobehavioral inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction, constituting targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery.","Heroin addiction imposes a devastating toll on society, with little known about its neurobiology.

One proposed mechanism is an imbalance in higher-order feedback re-entrant inputs to early sensory cortices during sensory perception, leading to increased propensity to focus on local object features over global context. We explored this theory by measuring visual evoked potentials during contour integration as considerable work has revealed that these processes are largely driven by feedback inputs from higher-order ventral visual stream regions. We tested the hypothesis that autistic individuals would have attenuated evoked responses to illusory contours compared with neurotypical controls. Electrophysiology was acquired while 29 autistic and 31 neurotypical children (7-17 years old, inclusive of both males and females) passively viewed a random series of Kanizsa figure stimuli, each consisting of four inducers that were aligned either at random rotational angles or such that contour integration would form an illusory square. Autistic children demonstrated attenuated automatic contour integration over lateral occipital regions relative to neurotypical controls. The data are discussed in terms of the role of predictive feedback processes on perception of global stimulus features and the notion that weakened “priors” may play a role in the visual processing anomalies seen in autism.","Individuals on the autism spectrum often exhibit atypicality in their sensory perception, but the neural underpinnings of these perceptual differences remain incompletely understood.

Whether the hippocampus is critical for TD remains unclear, with marked discrepancies between animal and human studies: although animals with discrete hippocampal lesions display impaired TD, human participants with similar lesions show intact performance on classic intertemporal choice tasks. A candidate explanation for this discrepancy is that delays and rewards are experienced in the moment in animal studies but tend to be hypothetical in human studies. We tested this hypothesis by examining the performance of amnesic participants with hippocampal lesions (one female, six males) on a novel experiential intertemporal choice task that used interesting photographs occluded by thick lines as rewards (Patt et al., 2021). Using a logistic function to model indifference points data, we compared performance to that on a classic intertemporal choice task with hypothetical outcomes. Participants with hippocampal lesions displayed impaired patterns of choices in the experiential task but not in the hypothetical task. Specifically, hippocampal lesions were associated with decreased amplitude of the delay-reward trade-off, with persistent choice of the delayed option despite delay increase. These results help explain previous discrepancies across animal and human studies, indicating that the hippocampus plays a critical role in temporal discounting when the outcomes of decisions are experienced in the moment, but not necessarily when they are hypothetical.","Temporal discounting (TD) represents the mental devaluation of rewards that are available after a delay.

Application of agonists to either AChRs generally, or mAChRs specifically, induced robust increases in network activity in the low-gamma range. Prolonged AChR stimulation for 48 h uncovered a population of hyperadapting CA3 pyramidal neurons that typically fired a single, early action potential in response to current injection. Although these neurons were present in control networks, their proportions were dramatically increased following long-term cholinergic activity. Characterized by the presence of a strong M-current, the hyperadaptation phenotype was abolished by acute application of either M-channel antagonists or the reapplication of AChR agonists.

Here, we explored the role of insula DYN/KOR circuit components on alcohol intake in a long-term intermittent access (IA) procedure. Using a combination of conditional knock-out strategies and site-directed pharmacology, we discovered distinct and sex-specific roles for insula DYN and KOR in alcohol drinking and related behavior. Our findings show that insula DYN deletion blocked escalated consumption and decreased the overall intake of and preference for alcohol in male and female mice. This effect was specific to alcohol in male mice, as DYN deletion did not impact sucrose intake. Further, insula KOR antagonism reduced alcohol intake and preference during the early phase of IA in male mice only. Alcohol consumption was not affected by insula KOR knockout in either sex. In addition, we found that long-term IA decreased the intrinsic excitability of DYN and deep layer pyramidal neurons (DLPNs) in the insula of male mice. Excitatory synaptic transmission was also impacted by IA, as it drove an increase in excitatory synaptic drive in both DYN neurons and DLPNs.

Studies using playback of USV sequences have used randomly selected sequences from numerous possibilities. The current study uses mutual-information to obtain context-specific natural sequences (NSeqs) of USV syllables capturing the observed predictability in male USVs in different contexts of social interaction with females. Behavioral and physiological significance of NSeqs over random sequences (RSeqs) lacking predictability were examined. Female mice, never having the social experience of being exposed to males, showed higher selectivity for NSeqs behaviorally and at cellular levels probed by expression of immediate early gene c-fos in Au1. The Au1 supragranular single-units also showed higher selectivity to NSeqs over RSeqs. Social-experience-driven plasticity in encoding NSeqs and RSeqs in adult females was probed by examining neural selectivities to the same sequences before and after the above social experience.

We then studied Scn1aR1407X/+ (Dravet syndrome; DS) and Scn8aN1768D/+ (D/+) mice of both sexes, two models of SUDEP, and found that convulsive seizures caused a postictal decrease in ventilation and severely depressed the HCVR in a subset of animals. Those mice with severe postictal depression of the HCVR also exhibited transient postictal hypothermia. A combination of blunted HCVR and abnormal thermoregulation is known to occur with dysfunction of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) system in mice. Depleting 5-HT with para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) mimicked seizure-induced hypoventilation, partially occluded the postictal decrease in the HCVR, exacerbated hypothermia, and increased postictal mortality in DS mice. Conversely, pretreatment with the 5-HT agonist fenfluramine reduced postictal inhibition of the HCVR and hypothermia. These results are consistent with the previous observation that seizures cause transient impairment of serotonergic neuron function, which would be expected to inhibit the many aspects of respiratory control dependent on 5-HT, including baseline ventilation and the HCVR. These results provide a scientific rationale to investigate the interictal and/or postictal HCVR as noninvasive biomarkers for those at high risk of seizure-induced death, and to prevent SUDEP by enhancing postictal 5-HT tone.","Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been linked to respiratory dysfunction, but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.

LAS activates the reticular formation; TMS activates descending systems, including corticoreticular fibers. Two hundred paired stimuli were used, with 50 ms interstimulus interval at which LAS suppresses TMS responses. Before and after stimulus pairing, responses in the contralateral biceps muscle to TMS alone were measured. Ten, 20, and 30 min after stimulus pairing ended, TMS responses were enhanced, indicating the induction of LTP. No long-term changes were seen in control experiments which used 200 unpaired TMS or LAS, indicating the importance of associative stimulation. Following paired stimulation, no changes were seen in responses to direct corticospinal stimulation at the level of the medulla, or in the extent of reaction time shortening by a loud sound (StartReact effect), suggesting that plasticity did not occur in corticospinal or reticulospinal synapses. Direct measurements in female monkeys undergoing a similar paired protocol revealed no enhancement of corticospinal volleys after paired stimulation, suggesting no changes occurred in intracortical connections. The most likely substrate for the plastic changes, consistent with all our measurements, is an increase in the efficacy of corticoreticular connections.

We studied escitalopram and fluoxetine using new intensity-based, drug-sensing fluorescent reporters targeted to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured neurons and mammalian cell lines. We also used chemical detection of drug within cells and phospholipid membranes.

Simultaneously, the drugs accumulate within lipid membranes by ≥18-fold (escitalopram) or 180-fold (fluoxetine), and possibly by much larger factors. Both drugs leave cytoplasm, lumen, and membranes just as quickly during washout. We synthesized membrane-impermeant quaternary amine derivatives of the two SSRIs. The quaternary derivatives are substantially excluded from membrane, cytoplasm, and ER for >2.4 h. They inhibit SERT transport-associated currents sixfold or 11-fold less potently than the SSRIs (escitalopram or fluoxetine derivative, respectively), providing useful probes for distinguishing compartmentalized SSRI effects. Although our measurements are orders of magnitude faster than the therapeutic lag of SSRIs, these data suggest that SSRI–SERT interactions within organelles or membranes may play roles during either the therapeutic effects or the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed treatment for individuals experiencing major depressive disorder. The therapeutic mechanisms that take place before, during, or after SSRIs bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) are poorly understood, partially because no studies exist on the cellular and subcellular pharmacokinetic properties of SSRIs in living cells. We studied sertraline and paroxetine using new intensity-based, drug-sensing fluorescent reporters targeted to the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cultured neurons and mammalian cell lines.

Age-related changes in several sleep characteristics indicate that reduced sleep quality is a frequent characteristic of aging. Conversely, sleep disruption may accelerate the aging process, yet it is not known what will happen to the age status of the brain if we can manipulate sleep conditions. To tackle this question, we used an approach of brain age to investigate whether sleep loss would cause age-related changes in the brain. We included MRI data of 134 healthy volunteers (mean chronological age of 25.3 between the age of 19 and 39 years, 42 females/92 males) from five datasets with different sleep conditions. Across three datasets with the condition of total sleep deprivation (>24 h of prolonged wakefulness), we consistently observed that total sleep deprivation increased brain age by 1–2 years regarding the group mean difference with the baseline. Interestingly, after one night of recovery sleep, brain age was not different from baseline. We also demonstrated the associations between the change in brain age after total sleep deprivation and the sleep variables measured during the recovery night. By contrast, brain age was not significantly changed by either acute (3 h time-in-bed for one night) or chronic partial sleep restriction (5 h time-in-bed for five continuous nights). Together, the convergent findings indicate that acute total sleep loss changes brain morphology in an aging-like direction in young participants and that these changes are reversible by recovery sleep.","Sleep loss pervasively affects the human brain at multiple levels.

We present a network model describing how the brain represents the semantic dependency relations among traits and uses this information to avoid an overall loss of positivity and coherence. Both male and female human participants received social feedback during a self-evaluation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We modeled self-belief updating by incorporating a reinforcement learning model within the network structure. Participants learned more rapidly from positive than negative feedback and were less likely to change self-views for traits with more dependencies in the network. Further, participants back propagated feedback across network relations while retrieving prior feedback on the basis of network similarity to inform ongoing self-views. Activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reflected the constrained updating process such that positive feedback led to higher activation and negative feedback to less activation for traits with more dependencies. Additionally, vmPFC was associated with the novelty of a trait relative to previously self-evaluated traits in the network, and angular gyrus was associated with greater certainty for self-beliefs given the relevance of prior feedback. We propose that neural computations that selectively enhance or attenuate social feedback and retrieve past relevant experiences to guide ongoing self-evaluations may support an overall positive and coherent self-concept.","People experience instances of social feedback as interdependent with potential implications for their entire self-concept.

From an ecological perspective, animals should adapt their foraging choices in dynamic environments to acquire nutrients that are essential for survival. Here, to advance the biological and ecological validity of RL models, we investigated how (male) monkeys adapt their choices to obtain preferred nutrient rewards under varying reward probabilities. We found that the nutrient composition of rewards strongly influenced learning and choices. Preferences of the animals for specific nutrients (sugar, fat) affected how they adapted to changing reward probabilities; the history of recent rewards influenced choices of the monkeys more strongly if these rewards contained the their preferred nutrients (nutrient-specific reward history). The monkeys also chose preferred nutrients even when they were associated with lower reward probability. A nutrient-sensitive RL model captured these processes; it updated the values of individual sugar and fat components of expected rewards based on experience and integrated them into subjective values that explained the choices of the monkeys. Nutrient-specific reward prediction errors guided this value-updating process. Our results identify nutrients as important reward components that guide learning and choice by influencing the subjective value of choice options.

RPE signals are encoded in the neural activity of multiple brain areas, such as midbrain dopaminergic neurons, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. However, it remains unclear how these signals are expressed through anatomically and functionally distinct subregions of the striatum. In the current study, we examined to which extent RPE signals are represented across different striatal regions. To do so, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic striatal territories of two male rhesus monkeys performing a free-choice probabilistic learning task. The trial-by-trial evolution of RPE during task performance was estimated using a reinforcement learning model fitted on monkeys' choice behavior. Overall, we found that changes in beta band oscillations (15–35 Hz), after the outcome of the animal's choice, are consistent with RPE encoding. Moreover, we provide evidence that the signals related to RPE are more strongly represented in the ventral (limbic) than dorsal (sensorimotor and associative) part of the striatum. To conclude, our results suggest a relationship between striatal beta oscillations and the evaluation of outcomes based on RPE signals and highlight a major contribution of the ventral striatum to the updating of learning processes.","Reward prediction error (RPE) signals are crucial for reinforcement learning and decision-making as they quantify the mismatch between predicted and obtained rewards.

To conclude, our results suggest a relationship between striatal beta oscillations and the evaluation of outcomes based on RPE signals and highlight a major contribution of the dorsal striatum to the updating of learning processes."

Here, we characterize the following three distinct forms of ethanol tolerance in male Drosophila: rapid, chronic, and repeated. Rapid tolerance is composed of two short-lived memory-like states, one that is labile and one that is consolidated. Chronic tolerance, induced by continuous exposure, lasts for 2 d, induces ethanol preference, and hinders the development of rapid tolerance through the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Unlike rapid tolerance, chronic tolerance is independent of the immediate early gene Hr38/Nr4a. Chronic tolerance is suppressed by the sirtuin HDAC Sirt1, whereas rapid tolerance is enhanced by Sirt1. Moreover, rapid and chronic tolerance map to anatomically distinct regions of the mushroom body learning and memory centers. Chronic tolerance, like long-term memory, is dependent on new protein synthesis and it induces the kayak/c-fos immediate early gene, but it depends on CREB signaling outside the mushroom bodies, and it does not require the Radish GTPase. Thus, chronic ethanol exposure creates an ethanol-specific memory-like state that is molecularly and anatomically different from other forms of ethanol tolerance.","Ethanol tolerance is the first type of behavioral plasticity and neural plasticity that is induced by ethanol intake, and yet its molecular and circuit bases remain largely unexplored.

The protein kinase C (PKC) family of isozymes has long been established as critical for synaptic plasticity. However, because of a lack of suitable isozyme-specific tools, the role of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes is largely unknown. Here, through the development of fluorescence lifetime imaging-fluorescence resonance energy transfer activity sensors, we investigate novel PKC isozymes in synaptic plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons of mice of either sex. We find that PKCδ is activated downstream of TrkB and DAG production, and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single-spine plasticity, PKCδ is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multispine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKCδ scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating cAMP response-element binding protein activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus. Thus, PKCδ plays a dual functional role in facilitating synaptic plasticity.","The activity-dependent plasticity of synapses is believed to be the cellular basis of learning.

Diet-mediated induction of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) recapitulates numerous features of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Here, we used astrocyte targeting approaches to evaluate astrocyte Ca2+ dysregulation and the impact of aberrant astrocyte signaling on cerebrovascular dysfunction and synapse impairment in male and female HHcy diet mice. Two-photon imaging conducted in fully awake mice revealed activity-dependent Ca2+ dysregulation in barrel cortex astrocytes under HHcy. Stimulation of contralateral whiskers elicited larger Ca2+ transients in individual astrocytes of HHcy diet mice compared with control diet mice. However, evoked Ca2+ signaling across astrocyte networks was impaired in HHcy mice. HHcy also was associated with increased activation of the Ca2+/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT4, which has been linked previously to the reactive astrocyte phenotype and synapse dysfunction in amyloid and brain injury models. Targeting the NFAT inhibitor VIVIT to astrocytes, using adeno-associated virus vectors, led to reduced GFAP promoter activity in HHcy diet mice and improved functional hyperemia in arterioles and capillaries. VIVIT expression in astrocytes also preserved CA1 synaptic function and improved spontaneous alternation performance on the Y maze. Together, the results demonstrate that aberrant astrocyte signaling can impair the major functional properties of the neurovascular unit (i.e., cerebral vessel regulation and synaptic regulation) and may therefore represent a promising drug target for treating VCID and possibly Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.","Despite the indispensable role that astrocytes play in the neurovascular unit, few studies have investigated the functional impact of astrocyte signaling in cognitive decline and dementia related to vascular pathology.

We find that information storage and sharing are organized into substates across the stereotypic states of slow and theta oscillations in both epilepsy and control conditions. However, their internal composition and organization through time are disrupted in epilepsy, partially losing brain state selectivity as compared to controls, and shifting towards a regimen of disorder.

In this study, we compared cellular and synaptic adaptations in the nucleus accumbens shell caused by morphine exposure that was either continuous or interrupted by daily bouts of naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. At the behavioral level, continuous morphine administration caused psychomotor tolerance, which was reversed when the continuity of morphine action was interrupted by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. Using ex vivo slice electrophysiology in female and male mice, we investigated how these patterns of morphine administration altered intrinsic excitability and synaptic plasticity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. We found that morphine-evoked adaptations at excitatory synapses were predominately conserved between patterns of administration, but there were divergent effects on inhibitory synapses and the subsequent balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Overall, our data suggest that continuous morphine administration produces adaptations that dampen the output of D1-MSNs, which are canonically thought to promote reward-related behaviors. Interruption of otherwise continuous morphine exposure does not dampen D1-MSN functional output to the same extent, which may enhance behavioral responses to subsequent opioid exposure.

Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset-triggered dopamine release, that is, the reward prediction error (RPE) signal, as both signal amplitude and sustainment diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.","The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes.

We have resolved the synaptic ribbon as a single structure, with a single arciform density, indicating the presence of one long site of transmitter release. The organization of the postsynaptic processes, which has been difficult to resolve with past methods, appears as a tetrad arrangement of two horizontal cell and two rod bipolar cell processes. Retinal detachment severely disrupts this organization. After 7 d, EM tomography reveals withdrawal of rod bipolar dendrites from most spherules; fragmentation of synaptic ribbons, which lose their tight association with the presynaptic membrane; and loss of the highly branched telodendria of the horizontal cell axon terminals. After detachment, the hilus, the opening through which postsynaptic processes enter the invagination, enlarges, exposing the normally sequestered environment within the invagination to the extracellular space of the outer plexiform layer.

Retinal detachment severely disrupts this organization. After 7 d, EM tomography reveals withdrawal of rod bipolar dendrites from most spherules; fragmentation of synaptic ribbons, which lose their tight association with the presynaptic membrane; and loss of the highly branched telodendria of the horizontal cell axon terminals. After detachment, the hilus, the opening through which postsynaptic processes enter the invagination, contracts, obscuring the normally sequestered environment within the invagination to the extracellular space of the outer plexiform layer. Our use of EM tomography provides the most accurate description to date of the complex rod synapse and details changes it undergoes during outer segment degeneration. These changes would be expected to disrupt the flow of information in the rod pathway."

Recent data show that adding win-paired sound and light cues to the rat gambling task (rGT) potentiates risky decision-making and impulsivity via the dopamine system, and that changing dopaminergic tone has a greater influence on behavior while subjects are learning task contingencies. Dopamine agonist therapy may therefore be potentiating risk-taking by amplifying the behavioral impact of gambling-related cues on novel behavior. Here, we show that ropinirole treatment in male rats transiently increased motor impulsivity but robustly and progressively increased choice of the high-risk/high-reward options when administered during acquisition of the cued but not uncued rGT. Early in training, ropinirole increased win-stay behavior after large unlikely wins on the cued rGT, indicative of enhanced model-free learning, which mediated the drug's effect on later risk preference. Ex vivo cFos imaging showed that both chronic ropinirole and the addition of win-paired cues suppressed the activity of dopaminergic midbrain neurons. The ratio of midbrain:prefrontal cFos+ neurons was lower in animals with suboptimal choice patterns and tended to predict risk preference across all rats. Network analyses further suggested that ropinirole induced decoupling of the dopaminergic cells of the VTA and nucleus accumbens but only when win-paired cues were present. Frontostriatal activity uninformed by the endogenous dopaminergic teaching signal therefore appeared to perpetuate risky choice, and ropinirole exaggerated this disconnect in synergy with reward-paired cues.","Impulse control and/or gambling disorders can be triggered by dopamine agonist therapies used to treat Parkinson's disease, but the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are unknown.

Reactive nitroxidative species, including NO and peroxynitrite (PN), have been implicated in nociceptive sensitization, and neutralizing PN is antinociceptive. We determined whether PN contributes to nociceptive responses in two distinct models of migraine headache. Female and male mice were subjected to 3 consecutive days of restraint stress or to dural stimulation with the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Following resolution of the initial poststimulus behavioral responses, animals were tested for hyperalgesic priming using a normally non-noxious dose of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or dural pH 7.0, respectively. We measured periorbital von Frey and grimace responses in both models and measured stress-induced changes in 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) expression (a marker for PN activity) and trigeminal ganglia (TGs) mitochondrial function. Additionally, we recorded the neuronal activity of TGs in response to the PN generator SIN-1 [5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)−1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride]. We then tested the effects of the PN decomposition catalysts Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl) porphyrin (FeTMPyP) and FeTPPS [Fe(III)5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato chloride], or the PN scavenger MnTBAP [Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin] against these behavioral, molecular, and neuronal changes. Neutralizing PN attenuated stress-induced periorbital hypersensitivity and priming to SNP, with no effect on priming to dural pH 7.0. These compounds also prevented stress-induced increases in 3-NT expression in both the TGs and dura mater, and attenuated TG neuronal hyperexcitability caused by SIN-1. Surprisingly, FeTMPyP attenuated changes in TG mitochondrial function caused by SNP in stressed males only. Together, these data strongly implicate PN in migraine mechanisms and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting PN.","Administration of a nitric oxide (NO) donor triggers migraine attacks, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown.

Previously, we found that the mechanisms for initiation of E2-induced synaptic potentiation differ between males and females, including in the molecular signaling involved. Here, we used electrical stimulation and two-photon glutamate uncaging in hippocampal slices from adult male and female rats to investigate whether the downstream consequences of distinct molecular signaling remain different between the sexes or converge to the same mechanism(s) of expression of potentiation. This showed that synaptic activity is necessary for expression of E2-induced potentiation in females but not males, which paralleled a sex-specific requirement in females for calcium-permeable AMPARs (cpAMPARs) to stabilize potentiation. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis of two-photon evoked unitary synaptic currents showed that the postsynaptic component of E2-induced potentiation occurs either through an increase in AMPAR conductance or in nonconductive properties of AMPARs (number of channels × open probability) and never both at the same synapse. In females, most synapses (76%) were potentiated via increased AMPAR conductance, whereas in males, more synapses (60%) were potentiated via an increase in nonconductive AMPAR properties. Inhibition of cpAMPARs eliminated E2-induced synaptic potentiation in females, whereas some synapses in males were unaffected by cpAMPAR inhibition; these synapses in males potentiated exclusively via increased AMPAR nonconductive properties. This sex bias in expression mechanisms of E2-induced synaptic potentiation underscores the concept of latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in which the same outcome in each sex is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms.","17β-estradiol (E2) is synthesized in the hippocampus of both sexes and acutely potentiates excitatory synapses in each sex.

We scanned 23 young (20-37 years) and 34 older (65-86 years) healthy human adults of both sexes with hybrid positron emission tomography/MRI. The radioligand [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose was used to assess dynamic changes in glucose metabolism as a marker of task-dependent synaptic activity, along with simultaneous fMRI BOLD imaging. Participants performed two verbal working memory (WM) tasks: one involving maintenance (easy) and one requiring manipulation (difficult) of information in WM. Converging activations to the WM tasks versus rest were observed for both imaging modalities and age groups in attentional, control, and sensorimotor networks. Upregulation of activity to WM-demand, comparing the more difficult to the easier task, also converged between both modalities and age groups. For regions in which older adults showed task-dependent BOLD overactivations compared with the young adults, no corresponding increases in glucose metabolism were found. To conclude, findings from the current study show that task-induced changes in the BOLD signal and synaptic activity as measured by glucose metabolism generally converge, but overactivations observed with fMRI in older adults are not coupled with increased synaptic activity, which suggests that these overactivations are not neuronal in origin.","A common observation in fMRI studies using the BOLD signal is that older adults, compared with young adults, show overactivations, particularly during less demanding tasks.

We scanned 23 young (20-37 years) and 34 older (65-86 years) healthy human adults of both sexes with hybrid positron emission tomography/MRI. The radioligand [18F]fluoro-deoxyglucose was used to assess dynamic changes in glucose metabolism as a marker of task-dependent synaptic activity, along with simultaneous fMRI BOLD imaging. Participants performed two verbal working memory (WM) tasks: one involving maintenance (easy) and one requiring manipulation (difficult) of information in WM. Converging activations to the WM tasks versus rest were observed for both imaging modalities and age groups in attentional, control, and visual networks. Upregulation of activity to WM-demand, comparing the more difficult to the easier task, also converged between both modalities and age groups. For regions in which older adults showed task-dependent BOLD overactivations compared with the young adults, the corresponding increases in glucose metabolism were found. To conclude, findings from the current study show that task-induced changes in the BOLD signal and synaptic activity as measured by glucose metabolism generally converge, and overactivations observed with fMRI in older adults are strongly coupled with increased synaptic activity, which suggests that these overactivations are neuronal in origin."

In parallel, olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis in α-syn-Tg mice was reduced in the OB granule cells at six to seven months and OB periglomerular cells at 12–14 months, respectively, both of which could contribute to olfactory dysfunction.

Transplanted astrocytes showed initially reduced expression of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) at endfeet and elevated expression of EAAT1/GLAST, with both proteins showing normalized expression by 110 d and one year post-transplantation, respectively. To understand how specific brain regions support astrocytic integration and maturation, we transplanted cortical astrocytes into the developing cerebellum. Cortical astrocytes interlaced with Bergmann glia (BG) in the cerebellar molecular layer to establish discrete territories.

Here, we examined how the primate vestibular system, independently and in combination with visual sensory input, contributes to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the range of dynamic motion experienced during daily life. We recorded activity of single motor units in the splenius capitis and sternocleidomastoid muscles in rhesus monkeys during yaw rotations spanning the physiological range of self-motion (up to 20 Hz) in darkness. Splenius capitis motor unit responses continued to increase with frequency up to 16 Hz in normal animals, and were strikingly absent following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. To determine whether visual information modulated these vestibular-driven neck muscle responses, we experimentally controlled the correspondence between visual and vestibular cues of self-motion. Surprisingly, visual information did not influence motor unit responses in normal animals, nor did it substitute for absent vestibular feedback following bilateral peripheral vestibular loss. A comparison of muscle activity evoked by broadband versus sinusoidal head motion further revealed that low-frequency responses were attenuated when low- and high-frequency self-motion were experienced concurrently. Finally, we found that vestibular-evoked responses were enhanced by increased autonomic arousal, quantified via pupil size. Together, our findings directly establish the vestibular system's contribution to the sensorimotor control of head posture across the dynamic motion range experienced during everyday activities, as well as how vestibular, visual, and autonomic inputs are integrated for postural control.","To maintain stable posture of the head and body during our everyday activities, the brain integrates information across multiple sensory systems.

Multiple pathophysiologic manifestations, along with many cellular and molecular alterations, have been linked to presbyacusis; however, the initial events and causal factors have not been clearly established. Comparisons of the transcriptome in the lateral wall (LW) with other cochlear regions in a mouse model (of both sexes) of “normal” age-related hearing loss revealed that early pathophysiological alterations in the stria vascularis (SV) are associated with increased macrophage activation and a molecular signature indicative of inflammaging, a common form of immune dysfunction. Structure-function correlation analyses in mice across the lifespan showed that the age-dependent increase in macrophage activation in the stria vascularis is associated with a decline in auditory sensitivity. High-resolution imaging analysis of macrophage activation in middle-aged and aged mouse and human cochleas, along with transcriptomic analysis of age-dependent changes in mouse cochlear macrophage gene expression, support the hypothesis that aberrant macrophage activity is an important contributor to age-dependent strial dysfunction, cochlear pathology, and hearing loss. Thus, this study highlights the SV as a primary site of age-related cochlear degeneration and aberrant macrophage activity and dysregulation of the immune system as early indicators of age-related cochlear pathology and hearing loss. Importantly, novel new imaging methods described here now provide a means to analyze human temporal bones in a way that had not previously been feasible and thereby represent a significant new tool for otopathological evaluation.","Age-related hearing loss, or presbyacusis, is a common degenerative disorder affecting communication and quality of life for millions of older adults. Multiple pathophysiologic manifestations, along with many cellular and molecular alterations, have been linked to presbyacusis; however, the initial events and causal factors have not been clearly established. Comparisons of the transcriptome in the lateral wall (LW) with other cochlear regions in a mouse model (of both sexes) of “normal” age-related hearing loss revealed that early pathophysiological alterations in the stria vascularis (SV) are associated with decreased macrophage activation and a molecular signature indicative of inflammaging, a common form of immune dysfunction. Structure-function correlation analyses in mice across the lifespan showed that the age-dependent decrease in macrophage activation in the stria vascularis is associated with a decline in auditory sensitivity. High-resolution imaging analysis of macrophage activation in middle-aged and aged mouse and human cochleas, along with transcriptomic analysis of age-dependent changes in mouse cochlear macrophage gene expression, support the hypothesis that decreased macrophage activity is an important contributor to age-dependent strial dysfunction, cochlear pathology, and hearing loss.

The balance between these major progenitor types is critical for the production of the proper number and types of neurons, and it is thus important to decipher the cellular and molecular cues controlling this equilibrium. Here we address the role of a cell cycle regulator, the CDC25B phosphatase, in this process. We show that, in the developing mouse neocortex of both sex, deleting CDC25B in apical progenitors leads to a transient increase in the production of TBR1+ neurons at the expense of TBR2+ basal progenitors. This phenotype is associated with lengthening of the G2 phase of the cell cycle, the total cell cycle length being unaffected. Using in utero electroporation and cortical slice cultures, we demonstrate that the defect in TBR2+ basal progenitor production requires interaction with CDK1 and is because of the G2 phase lengthening in CDC25B mutants. Together, this study identifies a new role for CDC25B and G2 phase length in direct versus indirect neurogenesis at early stages of cortical development.","During development, cortical neurons are produced in a temporally regulated sequence from apical progenitors, directly or indirectly, through the production of intermediate basal progenitors.

Our previous analysis of homozygous W246G mutant ELOVL4 rats (MUT) revealed early-onset gait disturbance and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (PF-PC) and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell (CF-PC) synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms that caused these defects remained unknown. Here, we report detailed patch-clamp recordings from Purkinje cells that identify impaired synaptic mechanisms. Our results show that miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency is reduced in MUT rats with no change in mEPSC amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic defect of excitatory synaptic transmission on Purkinje cells. We also find alterations in inhibitory synaptic transmission as miniature IPSC (mIPSC) frequency and amplitude are increased in MUT Purkinje cells. Paired-pulse ratio is reduced at PF-PC synapses but increased at CF-PC synapses in MUT rats, which along with results from high-frequency stimulation suggest opposite changes in the release probability at these two synapses. In contrast, we identify exaggerated persistence of EPSC amplitude at CF-PC and PF-PC synapses in MUT cerebellum, suggesting a larger readily releasable pool (RRP) at both synapses. Furthermore, the dendritic spine density is reduced in MUT Purkinje cells. Thus, our results uncover novel mechanisms of action of VLC-FA at cerebellar synapses, and elucidate the synaptic dysfunction underlying SCA34 pathology.","Elongation of very long fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) mediates biosynthesis of very long chain-fatty acids (VLC-FA; ≥28 carbons).

The extent to which individual γ-Pcdh family members play unique versus common roles remains unclear. We demonstrated previously that the γ-Pcdh-C3 isoform (γC3), via its unique “variable” cytoplasmic domain (VCD), interacts in cultured cells with Axin1, a Wnt-pathway scaffold protein that regulates the differentiation and morphology of neurons. Here, we confirm that γC3 and Axin1 interact in the cortex in vivo and show that both male and female mice specifically lacking γC3 exhibit disrupted Axin1 localization to synaptic fractions, without obvious changes in dendritic spine density or morphology. However, both male and female γC3 knock-out mice exhibit severely decreased dendritic complexity of cortical pyramidal neurons that is not observed in mouse lines lacking several other γ-Pcdh isoforms. Combining knock-out with rescue constructs in cultured cortical neurons pooled from both male and female mice, we show that γC3 promotes dendritic arborization through an Axin1-dependent mechanism mediated through its VCD. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism through which γC3 uniquely regulates the formation of cortical circuitry.","The establishment of a functional cerebral cortex depends on the proper execution of multiple developmental steps, culminating in dendritic and axonal outgrowth and the formation and maturation of synaptic connections.

Here, we recorded spiking responses to saccade-like shifts of luminance gratings from ganglion cells in isolated marmoset retinas and investigated how the activity depended on the combination of presaccadic and postsaccadic images. All identified cell types, On and Off parasol and midget cells, as well as a type of Large Off cells, displayed distinct response patterns, including particular sensitivity to either the presaccadic or the postsaccadic image or combinations thereof. In addition, Off parasol and Large Off cells, but not On cells, showed pronounced sensitivity to whether the image changed across the transition. Stimulus sensitivity of On cells could be explained based on their responses to step changes in light intensity, whereas Off cells, in particular, parasol and the Large Off cells, seem to be affected by additional interactions that are not triggered during simple light-intensity flashes. Together, our data show that ganglion cells in the primate retina are sensitive to different combinations of presaccadic and postsaccadic visual stimuli. This contributes to the functional diversity of the output signals of the retina and to asymmetries between On and Off pathways and provides evidence of signal processing beyond what is triggered by isolated steps in light intensity.","Saccades are a fundamental part of natural vision.

We find that, instead of changing abruptly, spindles gradually shift from being driven by slow waves to driving slow waves with age, reversing the coupling hierarchy typically seen in younger brains. Reversal was stronger the lower the slow-wave frequency, and starts around midlife (age range, ∼40–48 years), with an established reversed hierarchy between 56 and 83 years of age. Notably, coupling strength remains unaffected by age. In older adults, deteriorating slow wave–spindle coupling, measured using the phase slope index (PSI) and the number of coupling events, is associated with blood plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein levels, a marker for astrocyte activation. Data-driven models suggest that decreased sleep time and higher age lead to fewer coupling events, paralleled by increased astrocyte activation. Counterintuitively, astrocyte activation is associated with a backshift of the coupling hierarchy (PSI) toward a “younger” status along with increased coupling occurrence and strength, potentially suggesting compensatory processes.

To understand the thermosensory neural network for behavioral thermoregulation, in the present study, we investigated the roles of ascending thermosensory pathways from the LPB in avoidance behavior from innocuous heat and cold in male rats. Neuronal tracing revealed two segregated groups of LPB neurons projecting to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), a thermoregulatory center (LPB→MnPO neurons), and those projecting to the central amygdaloid nucleus (CeA), a limbic emotion center (LPB→CeA neurons). While LPB→MnPO neurons include separate subgroups activated by heat or cold exposure of rats, LPB→CeA neurons were only activated by cold exposure. By selectively inhibiting LPB→MnPO or LPB→CeA neurons using tetanus toxin light chain or chemogenetic or optogenetic techniques, we found that LPB→MnPO transmission mediates heat avoidance, whereas LPB→CeA transmission contributes to cold avoidance. In vivo electrophysiological experiments showed that skin cooling-evoked thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue requires not only LPB→MnPO neurons but also LPB→CeA neurons, providing a novel insight into the central mechanism of autonomous thermoregulation.

These cells serve as a key hub for regulating sleep and affective states. Ex vivo, PrRP hyperpolarized MCH neurons and further increased the hyperpolarization caused by NA. Following sleep deprivation, intracerebroventricular PrRP injection reduced the number of REM sleep-active MCH cells. PrRP expression in the dorsomedial nucleus was upregulated by sleep deprivation, while downregulated by REM sleep rebound.

Exposure to stress in the PrRP-insensitive period led to increased passive coping with stress. Normal PrRP signaling, therefore, seems to protect animals against stress-related disorders.

We focus on the ability of visuo-semantic models, consisting of human-generated labels of object features and categories, to explain variance beyond the explanatory power of DNNs alone. We report a gradual reversal in the relative importance of DNN versus visuo-semantic features as ventral-stream object representations unfold over space and time.

Among the visuo-semantic features, object parts and basic categories drive the advantage over DNNs. These results show that a significant component of the variance unexplained by DNNs in higher-level cortical dynamics is structured and can be explained by readily nameable aspects of the objects.

Among the visuo-semantic features, object parts and basic categories drive the advantage over DNNs. These results show that a significant component of the variance unexplained by DNNs in higher-level cortical dynamics is structured and can be explained by readily nameable aspects of the objects. We conclude that current DNNs fail to fully capture dynamic representations in higher-level human visual cortex and suggest a path toward more accurate models of ventral-stream computations."

We used fMRI to compare the morphology, connectivity, and encoding of the motor and tactile finger representations (FRs) in the precentral and postcentral gyrus of 25 5-fingered participants (8 females). Multivoxel pattern and structural and functional connectivity analyses demonstrated the existence of distinct motor and tactile FRs within both the precentral and postcentral gyrus, integrating finger-specific motor and tactile information. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the motor and tactile FRs in the sensorimotor cortex were described by the perceived structure of the hand better than by the actual hand anatomy or other functional models (finger kinematics, muscles synergies). We then studied a polydactyly individual (i.e., with a congenital 6-fingered hand) showing superior manipulation abilities and divergent anatomic-functional hand properties. The perceived hand model was still the best model for tactile representations in the precentral and postcentral gyrus, while finger kinematics better described motor representations in the precentral gyrus. We suggest that, under normal conditions (i.e., in subjects with a standard hand anatomy), the sensorimotor representations of the 5 fingers in humans converge toward a model of perceived hand anatomy, deviating from the real hand structure, as the best synthesis between functional and structural features of the hand.","Despite the tight coupling between sensory and motor processing for fine manipulation in humans, it is not yet totally clear which specific properties of the fingers are mapped in the precentral and postcentral gyrus.

Based on our real-life experience, we form strong expectations about how objects should behave under force, given their typical material properties. Such expectations have been shown to modulate perceptual processes, but we currently do not know how expectation influences the temporal dynamics of the cortical visual analysis for objects and their materials. Here, we tracked the neural representations of expected and unexpected material behaviors using time-resolved EEG decoding in a violation-of-expectation paradigm, where objects fell to the ground and deformed in expected or unexpected ways. Participants were 25 men and women. Our study yielded three key results: First, both objects and materials were represented rapidly and in a temporally sustained fashion. Second, objects exhibiting unexpected material behaviors were more successfully decoded than objects exhibiting expected behaviors within 190 ms after the impact, which might indicate additional processing demands when expectations are unmet. Third, general signals of expectation fulfillment that generalize across specific objects and materials were found within the first 150 ms after the impact. Together, our results provide new insights into the temporal neural processing cascade that underlies the analysis of real-world material behaviors. They reveal a sequence of predictions, with cortical signals progressing from a general signature of expectation fulfillment toward increased processing of unexpected material behaviors.","Material properties, such as softness or stickiness, determine how an object can be used.

However, it has been unclear whether this “dark-dominance” is because of more excitation from the OFF pathway or more inhibition from the ON pathway. To understand the mechanisms behind dark-dominance, we record electrophysiological responses of individual simple-type V1 neurons to natural image stimuli and then train biologically inspired convolutional neural networks to predict the neurons' responses. Analyzing a sample of 71 neurons (in anesthetized, paralyzed cats of either sex) has revealed their responses to be more driven by dark than light stimuli, consistent with previous investigations. We show that this asymmetry is predominantly because of slower inhibition to dark stimuli rather than to stronger excitation from the thalamocortical OFF pathway. Consistent with dark-dominant neurons having faster responses than light-dominant neurons, we find dark-dominance to solely occur in the early latencies of neurons' responses. Neurons that are strongly dark-dominated also tend to be less orientation-selective.

Model-based (MB) control is known to increase across development, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies. First, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Second, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A human developmental sample (n = 103; age, 12–50, male/female, 55:48) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive versus negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that gray matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. Although motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that brain maturation, putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions could lead to a more efficient brain organization and might thus be a key developmental step toward age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.","Cognition and brain structure undergo significant maturation from adolescence into adulthood.

First, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Second, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A human developmental sample (n = 103; age, 12–50, male/female, 55:48) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive versus negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that gray matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. Although motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by elevated GMD in the parietal, medial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that brain maturation, putatively reflected in higher GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions could lead to a more efficient brain organization and might thus be a key developmental step toward age-related increases in planning and value-based choice."

Our own data indicate that IL activity immediately following an unreinforced lever press is critical for encoding the extinction contingencies in such procedures. Whether extinction encoding requires activity in the IL exclusively or also activity in its outputs, such as those to the NAshell and amygdala, is unknown. To address this issue, we used a closed-loop optogenetic approach in female and male Sprague Dawley rats to silence IL–NAshell or IL–amygdala activity following an unreinforced lever press during extinction training. Optical illumination (20 s) was given either immediately after a lever press or following a 20 s delay. IL–NAshell inhibition immediately following an unreinforced lever press increased lever pressing during extinction training and impaired retention of extinction learning, as assessed during subsequent extinction sessions without optical inhibition. Likewise, IL–amygdala inhibition given in the same manner impaired extinction retention during sessions without inhibition. Control experiments indicate that critical encoding of extinction learning does not require activity in these pathways beyond the initial 20 s post-lever press period, as delayed IL–NAshell and IL–amygdala inhibition had no effect on extinction learning. These results suggest that a larger network extending from the IL to the NAshell and amygdala is involved in encoding extinction contingencies following cocaine self-administration.","Prior evidence indicates that the infralimbic cortex (IL) mediates the ongoing inhibition of cocaine seeking following self-administration and extinction training in rats, specifically through projections to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAshell).

Classical studies using the Posner paradigm have found that visual perception systematically benefits from the use of a spatially informative cue pointing to the to-be-attended spatial location, compared with a noninformative cue. Lateralized α amplitude modulation during visuospatial attention shifts has been suggested to account for such perceptual gain. However, recent studies on spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus α amplitude have challenged this notion. These studies showed that spontaneous fluctuations of prestimulus α amplitude were associated with the subjective appreciation of stimulus occurrence, while objective accuracy was instead best predicted by the frequency of α oscillations, with faster prestimulus α frequency accounting for better perceptual performance. Here, in male and female humans, by using an informative cue in anticipation of lateralized stimulus presentation, we found that the predictive cue not only modulates preparatory α amplitude but also α frequency in a retinotopic manner. Behaviorally, the cue significantly impacted subjective performance measures (metacognitive abilities [meta-d′]) and objective performance gain (d′). Importantly, α amplitude directly accounted for confidence levels, with ipsilateral synchronization and contralateral desynchronization coding for high-confidence responses. Crucially, the contralateral α amplitude selectively predicted interindividual differences in metacognitive abilities (meta-d′), thus anticipating decision strategy and not perceptual sensitivity, probably via excitability modulations. Instead, higher perceptual accuracy both within and across participants (d′) was associated with faster contralateral α frequency, likely by implementing higher sampling at the attended location. These findings provide critical new insights into the neural mechanisms of attention control and its perceptual consequences.","Behavioral consequences and neural underpinnings of visuospatial attention have long been investigated.

However, this relation has been unclear. To investigate this question, we used an in vivo microendoscope calcium imaging technique to optically record neuronal activity in the dCA1 of male and female mice.

Such increased response was specific to the conditioned context as it disappeared in neutral context. The magnitude of increase in neuronal responses by FC was proportional to memory strength during retrieval. The increases in activity preferentially occurred during the putative sharp wave ripple events and were not simply because of animal's movement and immobility. At the ensemble level, synchronous cell activity patterns were associated with memory retrieval. Accordingly, when such patterns were more similar between conditioned and neutral context, animals displayed proportionally more similar level of freezing.

For this purpose, we performed Sholl analysis of dendritic branches on primary hippocampal neurons and in acute hippocampal slices from WT mice and mice with genetic deficiency or pharmacological blockade of P2X7R. Because abnormal dendritic branching is a hallmark of certain neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia, a model of maternal immune activation (MIA)-induced schizophrenia, was used for further morphologic investigations. Subsequently, we studied MIA-induced behavioral deficits in young adult mice females and males.

Moreover, pathologic activation of the receptor led to deficits in dendritic outgrowth on primary neurons from WT mice but not those from P2X7R KO mice exposed to MIA.

The present study therefore examined the behavioral and neural effects of the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan on social reward and punishment processing in humans. A preregistered randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subject pharmacological design was combined with a social incentive delay (SID) functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm during which subjects could avoid social punishment or gain social reward. Healthy volunteers received a single-dose of losartan (50 mg, n = 43, female = 17) or placebo (n = 44, female = 20). We evaluated reaction times (RTs) and emotional ratings as behavioral and activation and functional connectivity as neural outcomes. Relative to placebo, losartan modulated the reaction time and arousal differences between social punishment and social reward. On the neural level the losartan-enhanced motivational salience of social rewards was accompanied by stronger ventral striatum-prefrontal connectivity during reward anticipation. Losartan increased the reward-neutral difference in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and attenuated VTA associated connectivity with the bilateral insula in response to punishment during the outcome phase. Thus, losartan modulated approach-avoidance motivation and emotional salience during social punishment versus social reward via modulating distinct core nodes of the midbrain-striato-frontal circuits. The findings document a modulatory role of the renin-angiotensin system in these circuits and associated social processes, suggesting a promising treatment target to alleviate social dysregulations.","Social deficits and dysregulations in dopaminergic midbrain-striato-frontal circuits represent transdiagnostic symptoms across psychiatric disorders.

Decreases within the cortico-cerebellar network were specific to dynamic adaptation, as they were associated with behavioral measures of adaptation and retention, indicating that this network has a functional role in consolidation. Instead, increases in rsFC within the cortical sensorimotor network were associated with motor control processes independent from adaptation and retention."

Despite recent advances in characterizing the brain basis of this ability in adults, its developmental underpinnings are virtually unknown. Here, we used fMRI to investigate which sources of social information support superior temporal sulcus responses to interactive biological motion (i.e., 2 interacting point-light human figures) at different developmental intervals in human participants (of either sex): Children show supportive functional connectivity with key nodes of the mentalizing network, while adults show stronger reliance on regions associated with body- and dynamic social interaction/biological motion processing. We suggest that adults use efficient action-intention understanding via body and biological motion information, while children show a stronger reliance on hidden mental state inferences as a potential means of learning to better understand others' interactive behavior.","Rapidly recognizing and understanding others' social interactions is an important ability that relies on deciphering multiple sources of information, for example, perceiving body information and inferring others' intentions.

Sleep homeostasis has traditionally been thought to be a product of neurons, but recent findings demonstrate that this process is also modulated by glial astrocytes. The precise role of astrocytes in the accumulation and discharge of sleep drive is unknown. We investigated this question by selectively activating basal forebrain (BF) astrocytes using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in male and female mice. DREADD activation of the Gq-protein-coupled pathway in BF astrocytes produced long and continuous periods of wakefulness that paradoxically did not cause the expected homeostatic response to sleep loss (e.g., increases in sleep time or intensity). Further investigations showed that this was not because of indirect effects of the ligand that activated DREADDs. These findings suggest that the need for sleep is not only driven by wakefulness per se, but also by specific neuronal-glial circuits that are differentially activated in wakefulness.","Mammalian sleep is regulated by a homeostatic process that increases sleep drive and intensity as a function of prior wake time.

However, this overrepresentation compromises the detection of approaching objects, which is essential for survival. In the present study, we revisited this long-held notion by reanalyzing motion selectivity in area MT of three macaque monkeys (two males, one female) using random-dot stimuli instead of spot stimuli. We found no differences in the number of neurons tuned to centrifugal versus centripetal motion; however, centrifugally tuned neurons showed stronger tuning than centripetally tuned neurons. This was attributed to the heightened suppression of responses in centrifugal neurons to centripetal motion compared with that of centripetal neurons to centrifugal motion. Our modeling implies that this intensified suppression accounts for superior detection performance for weak centripetal motion stimuli. Moreover, through Fisher information analysis, we establish that the population sensitivity to motion direction in peripheral vision corresponds well with retinal motion statistics during forward locomotion. While these results challenge established concepts, considering the interplay of logarithmic Gaussian receptive fields and spot stimuli can shed light on the previously documented overrepresentation of centrifugal motion. Significantly, our findings reconcile a previously found discrepancy between MT activity and human behavior, highlighting the proficiency of peripheral MT neurons in encoding motion direction efficiently.","The overrepresentation of centrifugal motion in the middle temporal visual area (area MT) has long been thought to provide an efficient coding strategy for optic flow processing.

However, the circuit mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. In mice, a decrease of SynGAP levels results in cognitive deficits by interfering with the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Recent evidence suggests that SynGAP also plays a crucial role in the development and function of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the expression of SYNGAP1 in inhibitory interneurons contributes to cortical circuit function and related behaviors. The activity of cortical neurons has not been measured simultaneously with behavior. To address these gaps, we recorded from layer 2/3 neurons in the primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) of mice while they learned to perform a whisker tactile detection task. Our results demonstrate that mice with interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency exhibit learning deficits characterized by heightened behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to unrelated sensory stimuli not associated with reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by specific circuit abnormalities within wS1. Interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency increases detrimental neuronal correlations directly related to task performance and enhances responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli unrelated to the reward acquisition. In summary, our findings indicate that a reduction of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons impairs sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex by disrupting neuronal correlations, which likely contributes to the observed cognitive deficits in mice with pan-neuronal SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.","SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans leads to severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits.

However, the role of endogenously synthesized creatine on CNS development and function remains poorly understood. Here, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of adult mouse brains from both sexes revealed creatine synthesis is dependent on the expression of the enzyme, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT). To identify Gamt-expressed cells, and how Gamtaffects postnatal CNS development, we generated a mouse line by knocking-in a GFP, which is expressed on excision of Gamt. We found that Gamt is expressed in mature oligodendrocytes during active myelination in the developing postnatal CNS. Homozygous deletion of Gamt resulted in significantly reduced mature oligodendrocytes and delayed myelination in the corpus callosum. Moreover, the absence of endogenous creatine resulted in altered AMPK signaling in the brain, reduced brain creatine kinase expression in cortical neurons, and signs of axonal damage. Experimental demyelination in mice after tamoxifen-induced conditional deletion of Gamt in oligodendrocyte lineage cells resulted in delayed maturation of oligodendrocytes and myelin coverage in lesions. Moreover, creatine and cyclocreatine supplementation can enhance remyelination after demyelination. Our results suggest endogenously synthesized creatine controls the bioenergetic demand required for the timely maturation of oligodendrocytes during postnatal CNS development, and that delayed myelination and altered CNS energetics through the disruption of creatine synthesis might contribute to conditions, such as CCDS.","Cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome (CCDS) is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by intellectual delays, seizures, and autistic-like behavior.

A total of 740 participants who reported to sleep <6 h did not experience daytime sleepiness or sleep problems/disturbances interfering with falling or staying asleep. These short sleepers showed significantly larger regional brain volumes than both short sleepers with daytime sleepiness and sleep problems (n = 1742) and participants sleeping the recommended 7–8 h (n = 3886). However, both groups of short sleepers showed slightly lower general cognitive function (GCA), 0.16 and 0.19 SDs, respectively.

The results suggest that some people can cope with less sleep without obvious negative associations with brain morphometry and that sleepiness and sleep problems may be more related to brain structural differences than duration.

To test these predictions, we designed a dataset of closely matched normal and jabberwocky sentences (composed of meaningless pseudo words) and displayed them to deep language models and to 11 human participants (5 men and 6 women) monitored with simultaneous MEG and intracranial EEG. In both deep language models and electrophysiological data, we found that representational dimensionality was higher for meaningful sentences than jabberwocky. Furthermore, multivariate decoding of normal versus jabberwocky confirmed three dynamic patterns: (1) a phasic pattern following each word, peaking in temporal and parietal areas; (2) a ramping pattern, characteristic of bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri; and (3) a sentence-final pattern in left superior frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex.

Furthermore, multivariate decoding of normal versus jabberwocky confirmed three dynamic patterns: (1) a phasic pattern following each word, peaking in left superior frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex; (2) a ramping pattern, characteristic of bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri; and (3) a sentence-final pattern in temporal and parietal areas. These results provide a first glimpse into the neural geometry of semantic integration and constrain the search for a neural code of linguistic composition."

The automatic formation, and later retrieval, of such conjunctive representations can substantially facilitate efficient action selection. However, recent behavioral work suggests that these event files may also adversely affect future behavior, especially when action requirements have changed between successive instances of the same task context (e.g., during task switching). Here, we directly tested this hypothesis with a recently developed method for measuring the strength of the neural representations of context-specific stimulus–action conjunctions (i.e., event files). Thirty-five male and female adult humans performed a task switching paradigm while undergoing EEG recordings. Replicating previous behavioral work, we found that changes in action requirements between two spaced repetitions of the same task incurred a significant reaction time cost. By combining multivariate pattern analysis and representational similarity analysis of the EEG recordings with linear mixed-effects modeling of trial-to-trial behavior, we then found that the magnitude of this behavioral cost was directly proportional to the strength of the conjunctive representation formed during the most recent previous exposure to the same task, that is, the most recent event file. This confirms that the formation of conjunctive representations of specific task contexts, stimuli, and actions in the brain can indeed adversely affect future behavior. Moreover, these findings demonstrate the potential of neural decoding of complex task set representations toward the prediction of behavior beyond the current trial.","During goal-directed behavior, humans purportedly form and retrieve so-called event files, conjunctive representations that link context-specific information about stimuli, their associated actions, and the expected action outcomes.

Under ketamine, responses were nonoscillatory, as in the awake condition. Response entrainment to the monitor refresh was commonly observed up to 120 Hz and was superseded by the gamma oscillatory responses induced by halothane.

Moreover, it remains unknown whether neurons united in a common goal and comprising the same sensory circuit develop on similar timescales and use identical molecular approaches to ensure the formation of the correct number of synapses. To begin to answer these questions, we took advantage of the Drosophila antennal lobe (AL), a model olfactory circuit with remarkable genetic access and synapse-level resolution. Using tissue-specific genetic labeling of active zones, we performed a quantitative analysis of synapse formation in multiple classes of neurons of both sexes throughout development and adulthood. We found that olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), and local interneurons (LNs) each have unique time courses of synaptic development, addition, and refinement, demonstrating that each class follows a distinct developmental program. This raised the possibility that these classes may also have distinct molecular requirements for synapse formation. We genetically altered neuronal activity in each neuronal subtype and observed differing effects on synapse number based on the neuronal class examined. Silencing neuronal activity in ORNs, PNs, and LNs impaired synaptic development but only in ORNs did enhancing neuronal activity influence synapse formation. ORNs and LNs demonstrated similar impairment of synaptic development with enhanced activity of a master kinase, GSK-3β, suggesting that neuronal activity and GSK-3β kinase activity function in a common pathway. ORNs also, however, demonstrated impaired synaptic development with GSK-3β loss-of-function, suggesting additional activity-independent roles in development. Ultimately, our results suggest that the requirements for synaptic development are not uniform across all neuronal classes with considerable diversity existing in both their developmental time frames and molecular requirements. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of synaptic development and lay the foundation for future work determining their underlying etiologies.","Developing neurons must meet core molecular, cellular, and temporal requirements to ensure the correct formation of synapses, resulting in functional circuits.

Once the prior knowledge was introduced, a Dalmatian dog could be consciously seen, and the picture immediately became meaningful. Using pictures with hidden objects as standard stimuli and similar pictures without hidden objects as deviant stimuli, we investigated the neural representation of prior knowledge and its impact on conscious perception in an oddball paradigm using electroencephalogram (EEG) in both male and female human subjects. We found that the neural patterns between the prestimulus alpha band oscillations and poststimulus EEG activity were significantly more similar for the standard stimuli than for the deviant stimuli after prior knowledge was provided. Furthermore, decoding analysis revealed that persistent neural templates were evoked after the introduction of prior knowledge, similar to that evoked in the early stages of visual processing. In conclusion, the current study suggests that prior knowledge uses alpha band oscillations in a multivariate manner in the prestimulus period and induces specific persistent neural templates in the poststimulus period, enabling the conscious perception of the hidden objects.","Prior knowledge has a profound impact on the way we perceive the world.

We investigated how torque information is encoded by human tactile afferents in the fingerpads and compared them to 97 afferents recorded in monkeys (n = 3; 2 females) in our previous study. Human data included slowly-adapting Type-II (SA-II) afferents, which are absent in the glabrous skin of monkeys. Torques of different magnitudes (3.5–7.5 mNm) were applied in clockwise and anticlockwise directions to a standard central site on the fingerpads of 34 human subjects (19 females). Torques were superimposed on a 2, 3, or 4 N background normal force. Unitary recordings were made from fast-adapting Type-I (FA-I, n = 39), and slowly-adapting Type-I (SA-I, n = 31) and Type-II (SA-II, n = 13) afferents supplying the fingerpads via microelectrodes inserted into the median nerve. All three afferent types encoded torque magnitude and direction, with torque sensitivity being higher with smaller normal forces. SA-I afferent responses to static torque were inferior to dynamic stimuli in humans, while in monkeys the opposite was true. In humans this might be compensated by the addition of sustained SA-II afferent input, and their capacity to increase or decrease firing rates with direction of rotation. We conclude that the discrimination capacity of individual afferents of each type was inferior in humans than monkeys which could be because of differences in fingertip tissue compliance and skin friction.","Dexterous object manipulation depends critically on information about forces normal and tangential to the fingerpads, and also on torque associated with object orientation at grip surfaces.

Under normal physiological conditions, synaptic transmission between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the neighboring main island (Im) of GABAergic intercalated cells (ITCs) is strongly inhibited by endogenous opioids.

https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1663-22.2023,Behavioral/Cognitive,"The amplitude envelope of speech is crucial for accurate comprehension. Considered a key stage in speech processing, the phase of neural activity in the theta-delta bands (1-10 Hz) tracks the phase of the speech amplitude envelope during listening. However, the mechanisms underlying this envelope representation have been heavily debated. A dominant model posits that envelope tracking reflects entrainment of endogenous low-frequency oscillations to the speech envelope. Alternatively, envelope tracking reflects a series of evoked responses to acoustic landmarks within the envelope. It has proven challenging to distinguish these two mechanisms. To address this, we recorded MEG while participants (n = 12, 6 female) listened to natural speech, and compared the neural phase patterns to the predictions of two computational models: an oscillatory entrainment model and a model of evoked responses to peaks in the rate of envelope change. Critically, we also presented speech at slowed rates, where the spectro-temporal predictions of the two models diverge. Our analyses revealed transient theta phase-locking in regular speech, as predicted by both models. However, for slow speech, we found transient theta and delta phase-locking, a pattern that was fully compatible with the evoked response model but could not be explained by the oscillatory entrainment model. Furthermore, encoding of acoustic edge magnitudes was invariant to contextual speech rate, demonstrating speech rate normalization of acoustic edge representations. Together, our results suggest that neural phase-locking to the speech envelope is more likely to reflect discrete representation of transient information rather than oscillatory entrainment.","The amplitude envelope of speech is crucial for accurate comprehension.

Ring (R) neurons are critical components in the Drosophila central complex, which has been implicated in multiple visually guided behaviors. Using two-photon calcium imaging with female flies, we demonstrated that a specific population of R neurons that innervate the superior domain of bulb neuropil, termed superior R neurons, encoded a motion-defined bar with high spatial frequency contents. Upstream superior tuberculo-bulbar (TuBu) neurons transmitted visual signals by releasing acetylcholine within synapses connected with superior R neurons. Blocking TuBu or R neurons impaired tracking performance of the bar, which reveals their importance in motion-defined feature encoding. Additionally, the presentation of a low spatial frequency luminance-defined bar evoked consistent excitation in R neurons of the superior bulb, whereas either excited or inhibited responses were evoked in the inferior bulb. The distinct properties of the responses to the two bar stimuli indicate there is a functional division between the bulb subdomains. Moreover, physiological and behavioral tests with restricted lines suggest that R4d neurons play a vital role in tracking motion-defined bars. We conclude that the central complex receives the motion-defined features via a visual pathway from superior TuBu to R neurons and might encode different visual features via distinct response patterns at the population level, thereby driving visually guided behaviors.","Relative motion breaks a camouflaged target from a same-textured background, thus eliciting discrimination of a motion-defined object.

However, functional aspects of locomotion, such as negotiating obstacles, remains challenging. We collected kinematic and electromyography data in 10 adult cats (5 males, 5 females) before and at weeks 1-2 and 7-8 after a lateral mid-thoracic hemisection on the right side of the cord while they negotiated obstacles of three different heights. Intact cats always cleared obstacles without contact. At weeks 1-2 after hemisection, the ipsilesional right hindlimb contacted obstacles in ∼50% of trials, triggering a stumbling corrective reaction or absent responses, which we termed Other. When complete clearance occurred, we observed exaggerated ipsilesional hindlimb flexion when crossing the obstacle with contralesional Left limbs leading. At weeks 7-8 after hemisection, the proportion of complete clearance increased, Other responses decreased, and stumbling corrective reactions remained relatively unchanged. We found redistribution of weight support after hemisection, with reduced diagonal supports and increased homolateral supports, particularly on the left contralesional side. The main neural strategy for complete clearance in intact cats consisted of increased knee flexor activation. After hemisection, ipsilesional knee flexor activation remained, but it was insufficient or more variable as the limb approached the obstacle. Intact cats also increased their speed when stepping over an obstacle, an increase that disappeared after hemisection. The increase in complete clearance over time after hemisection paralleled the recovery of muscle activation patterns or new strategies. Our results suggest partial recovery of anticipatory control through neuroplastic changes in the locomotor control system.","Following incomplete spinal cord injury in animals, including humans, substantial locomotor recovery can occur.

The behavioral results showed that human participants of both sexes were more likely to change their preferences to match those of a superior partner in a public than in a private context. fMRI data revealed distinct contributions of the subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to increased conformity to social hierarchy under observation. Specifically, the ventral mPFC showed increased activity when participants' preferences aligned with those of superior partners, regardless of behavioral manifestation. The rostral mPFC showed increased activity when conforming to a superior partner and nonconforming to an inferior one, indicating goal-dependent valuation. The dorsal mPFC showed increased activity in private conditions with a superior partner but only in those with a higher tendency to conform. These findings support the hierarchical allostatic regulation model of the mPFC function for social valuation and suggest strategic conformity as a way to minimize metabolic costs.","People often align their behaviors and decisions with others' expectations, especially those of higher social positions, when they are being observed.

However, it is unclear whether these effects extend beyond pure sensory vagal nerve responses. Critically, the potential of the pupillary light reflex as an additional taVNS biomarker has not been explored so far. Here, we applied phasic active and sham taVNS in 29 subjects (16 female, 13 male) while they performed an emotional Stroop task (EST) and a passive pupil light reflex task (PLRT). We recorded pupil size and brain activity dynamics using a combined Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry design. Our results show that phasic taVNS significantly increased pupil dilation and performance during the EST. During the PLRT, active taVNS reduced and delayed pupil constriction. In the MEG, taVNS increased frontal-midline theta and alpha power during the EST, whereas occipital alpha power was reduced during both the EST and PLRT. Our findings provide evidence that phasic taVNS systematically modulates behavioral, pupillary, and electrophysiological parameters of LC-NA activity during cognitive processing. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the pupillary light reflex can be used as a simple and effective proxy of taVNS efficacy. These findings have important implications for the development of noninvasive neuromodulation interventions for various cognitive and clinical applications.","Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proposed to activate the locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system.

Rhythmic interactions, especially in the theta band, between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and limbic structures are thought to play an important role, but the ways in which memory processing occurs at a mechanistic and circuits level are largely unknown. To investigate how rhythmic interactions lead to fear extinction during REM sleep, we used a biophysically based model that included the infralimbic cortex (IL), a part of the mPFC with a critical role in suppressing fear memories. Theta frequency (4–12 Hz) inputs to a given cell assembly in IL, representing an emotional memory, resulted in the strengthening of connections from the IL to the amygdala and the weakening of connections from the amygdala to the IL, resulting in the suppression of the activity of fear expression cells for the associated memory. Lower frequency (4 Hz) theta inputs effected these changes over a wider range of input strengths. In contrast, inputs at other frequencies were ineffective at causing these synaptic changes and did not suppress fear memories. Under post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) REM sleep conditions, rhythmic activity dissipated, and 4 Hz theta inputs to IL were ineffective, but higher-frequency (10 Hz) theta inputs to IL induced changes similar to those seen with 4 Hz inputs under normal REM sleep conditions, resulting in the suppression of fear expression cells. These results suggest why PTSD patients may repeatedly experience the same emotionally charged dreams and suggest potential neuromodulatory therapies for the amelioration of PTSD symptoms.","REM sleep is important for the processing of emotional memories, including fear memories.

Here, we used connectivity measures that can isolate the communications of a specific content to reconstruct these network mechanisms in each individual participant (N = 11, both sexes). Each was cued to the spatial location (left vs right) and contents [low spatial frequency (LSF) vs high spatial frequency (HSF)] of a predicted Gabor stimulus that they then categorized. Using each participant's concurrently measured MEG, we reconstructed networks that predict and categorize LSF versus HSF contents for behavior. We found that predicted contents flexibly propagate top down from temporal to lateralized occipital cortex, depending on task demands, under supervisory control of prefrontal cortex. When they reach lateralized occipital cortex, predictions enhance the bottom-up LSF versus HSF representations of the stimulus, all the way from occipital-ventral-parietal to premotor cortex, in turn producing faster categorization behavior. Importantly, content communications are subsets (i.e., 55–75%) of the signal-to-signal communications typically measured between brain regions.

CRH mRNA and protein levels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are increased in primary hypertension. However, the role of CRH in elevated sympathetic outflow in primary hypertension remains unclear. CRHR1 proteins were distributed in retrogradely labeled PVN presympathetic neurons with an increased level in the PVN tissue in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared with age-matched male Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats. CRH induced a more significant increase in the firing rate of PVN-rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons and sympathoexcitatory response in SHRs than in WKY rats, an effect that was blocked by preapplication of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) antagonist AP5 and PSD-95 inhibitor, Tat-N-dimer. Blocking CRHRs with astressin or CRHR1 with NBI35965 significantly decreased the firing rate of PVN-RVLM output neurons and reduced arterial blood pressure (ABP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in SHRs but not in WKY, whereas blocking CRHR2 with antisauvagine-30 did not. Furthermore, Immunocytochemistry staining revealed that CRHR1 colocalized with NMDARs in PVN presympathetic neurons. Blocking CRHRs significantly decreased the NMDA currents in labeled PVN neurons. PSD-95-bound CRHR1 and PSD-95-bound GluN2A in the PVN were increased in SHRs. These data suggested that the upregulation of CRHR1 in the PVN is critically involved in the hyperactivity of PVN presympathetic neurons and elevated sympathetic outflow in primary hypertension.","Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a neuropeptide regulating neuroendocrine and autonomic function.

Cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neurobiological signature of sign-tracking behaviors. Here, we examine a critical regulator of the dopamine system, endocannabinoids, which bind the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to control cue-evoked striatal dopamine levels. We use cell type-specific optogenetics, intra-VTA pharmacology, and fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that VTA CB1R receptor signaling regulates NAc dopamine levels to control sign tracking. We trained male and female rats in a Pavlovian lever autoshaping (PLA) task to determine their tracking groups before testing the effect of VTA → NAc dopamine inhibition. We found that this circuit is critical for mediating the vigor of the ST response. Upstream of this circuit, intra-VTA infusions of rimonabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, during PLA decrease lever and increase food cup approach in sign-trackers. Using fiber photometry to measure fluorescent signals from a dopamine sensor, GRABDA (AAV9-hSyn-DA2m), we tested the effects of intra-VTA rimonabant on NAc dopamine dynamics during autoshaping in female rats. We found that intra-VTA rimonabant decreased sign-tracking behaviors, which was associated with increases in NAc shell, but not core, dopamine levels during reward delivery [unconditioned stimulus (US)]. Our results suggest that CB1R signaling in the VTA influences the balance between the conditioned stimulus-evoked and US-evoked dopamine responses in the NAc shell and biases behavioral responding to cues in sign-tracking rats.","Sign-tracking (ST) rats show enhanced cue sensitivity before drug experience that predicts greater discrete cue-induced drug seeking compared with goal-tracking or intermediate rats.

Theoretically, intrinsic timescales are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli at multiple stages. However, direct links between timescales at rest and sensory processing, as well as translation to the auditory system are lacking. Here, we measured intracranial EEG in 11 human patients with epilepsy (4 women), while listening to pure tones. We show that, in the auditory network, intrinsic neural timescales progressively increase, while the spectral exponent flattens, from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Within the neocortex, intrinsic timescales exhibit spatial gradients that follow the temporal lobe anatomy. Crucially, intrinsic timescales at baseline can explain the latency of auditory responses: as intrinsic timescales increase, so do the single-electrode response onset and peak latencies. Our results suggest that the human auditory network exhibits a repertoire of intrinsic neural dynamics, which manifest in cortical gradients with millimeter resolution and may provide a variety of temporal windows to support auditory processing.","During rest, intrinsic neural dynamics manifest at multiple timescales, which progressively increase along visual and somatosensory hierarchies.

The postsynaptic protein Shank3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains) is of particular interest, as the loss of a single allele of the SHANK3 gene is sufficient to cause profound cognitive symptoms in children. We thus sought to determine whether a SHANK3 deficiency could contribute to the emergence or worsening of AD symptoms and neuropathology. We first found a 30%-50% postmortem loss of SHANK3a associated with cognitive decline in the parietal cortex of individuals with AD. To further probe the role of SHANK3 in AD, we crossed male and female 3xTg-AD mice modelling Aβ and tau pathologies with Shank3a-deficient mice (Shank3Δex4-9). We observed synergistic deleterious effects of Shank3a deficiency and AD neuropathology on object recognition memory at 9, 12, and 18 months of age and on anxious behavior at 9 and 12 months of age in hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9-3xTg-AD mice. In addition to the expected 50% loss of Shank3a, levels of other synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, drebrin, and homer1, remained unchanged in the parietotemporal cortex of hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9 animals. However, Shank3a deficiency increased the levels of soluble Aβ42 and human tau at 18 months of age compared with 3xTg-AD mice with normal Shank3 expression. The results of this study in human brain samples and in transgenic mice are consistent with the hypothesis that Shank3 deficiency makes a key contribution to cognitive impairment in AD.","Synaptic loss is intrinsically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and symptoms, but its direct impact on clinical symptoms remains elusive.

Here, we study the BOLD response to the same motion stimuli in 5-week-old infants (four females and four males) and compare the maturation between these two ages.

In infants and in adults, primary visual cortex (V1) does not show a selectivity for coherent motion but shows very fast development between 5 and 8 weeks of age in response to the appearance of motion stimuli. Resting-state correlations demonstrate adult-like functional connectivity between the motion-selective associative areas but not between primary cortex and temporo-occipital and posterior-insular cortices.

In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (Giraud and Poeppel, 2012; Peelle and Davis, 2012; Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed heterogeneous tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were stereotyped. Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (<8 Hz), and an over-representation of amplitude edges was apparent in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes. Crucially, this encoding bias imparted a decoding benefit: a classifier could discriminate vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity, while higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder that tracked spiking responses from individual cells. Together, our results imply that the envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code.","Animal communication sounds exhibit complex temporal structure because of the amplitude fluctuations that comprise the sound envelope. In human speech, envelope modulations drive synchronized activity in auditory cortex (AC), which correlates strongly with comprehension (Giraud and Poeppel, 2012; Peelle and Davis, 2012; Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018). Studies of envelope coding in single neurons, performed in nonhuman animals, have focused on periodic amplitude modulation (AM) stimuli and use response metrics that are not easy to juxtapose with data from humans. In this study, we sought to bridge these fields. Specifically, we looked directly at the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking, and we assessed whether the apparent diversity across neurons' AM responses contributes to the population representation of speech-like sound envelopes. We gathered responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli and compared them to sinusoidal AM responses in auditory cortex (AC) of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes. While AC neurons displayed stereotyped tuning to AM rate, their temporal dynamics were heterogeneous.

However, it remains unclear how audiovisual (AV) temporal coherence and auditory selective attention interact at the neurophysiological level. Here, we measured neural activity using EEG while human participants (men and women) performed an auditory selective attention task, detecting deviants in a target audio stream. The amplitude envelope of the two competing auditory streams changed independently, while the radius of a visual disk was manipulated to control the AV coherence. Analysis of the neural responses to the sound envelope demonstrated that auditory responses were enhanced largely independently of the attentional condition: both target and masker stream responses were enhanced when temporally coherent with the visual stimulus. In contrast, attention enhanced the event-related response evoked by the transient deviants, largely independently of AV coherence. These results provide evidence for dissociable neural signatures of bottom-up (coherence) and top-down (attention) effects in AV object formation.","Previous work has demonstrated that performance in an auditory selective attention task can be enhanced or impaired, depending on whether a task-irrelevant visual stimulus is temporally coherent with a target auditory stream or with a competing distractor.

However, children initially show poor EF and prolonged development. Do children recruit the same network as adults? Is it functionally and connectionally distinct from adjacent language cortex, as in adults? And is this activation or connectivity dependent on age or ability? We examine task-dependent (spatial working memory and passive language tasks) and resting state functional data in 44 adults (18-38 years, 68% female) and 37 children (4-12 years, 35% female). Subject-specific functional ROIs (ss-fROIs) show bilateral MD network activation in children. In both children and adults, these MD ss-fROIs are not recruited for linguistic processing and are connectionally distinct from language ss-fROIs. While MD activation was lower in children than in adults (even in motion- and performance-matched groups), both showed increasing MD activation with better performance, especially in right hemisphere ss-fROIs. We observe this relationship even when controlling for age, cross-sectionally and in a small longitudinal sample of children. These data suggest that the MD network is selective to cognitive demand in children, is distinct from adjacent language cortex, and increases in selectivity as performance improves. These findings show that neural structures subserving domain-general EF emerge early and are sensitive to ability even in children.

They could occur either via a change in sensory processing itself and/or during postperceptual processes such as maintenance or decision-making. To address this, we tested 20 participants (11 female) and analyzed behavioral and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data from a working-memory task in which participants were sequentially presented with two randomly oriented gratings, one of which was cued for recall at the end of the trial. Behavioral responses showed evidence for two distinct biases: (1) a within-trial repulsive bias away from the previously encoded orientation on the same trial, and (2) a between-trial attractive bias toward the task-relevant orientation on the previous trial. Multivariate classification of stimulus orientation revealed that neural representations during stimulus encoding were biased away from the previous grating orientation, regardless of whether we considered the within-trial or between-trial prior orientation, despite opposite effects on behavior. These results suggest that repulsive biases occur at the level of sensory processing and can be overridden at postperceptual stages to result in attractive biases in behavior.","Behavioral reports of sensory information are biased by stimulus history.

CSD is also thought to drive the headache phase in migraine by promoting the activation and mechanical sensitization of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive neurons that innervate the cranial meninges. The factors underlying meningeal nociception in the wake of CSD remain poorly understood but potentially involve the parenchymal release of algesic mediators and damage-associated molecular patterns, particularly ATP. Here, we explored the role of ATP-P2X purinergic receptor signaling in mediating CSD-evoked meningeal afferent activation and mechanical sensitization. Male rats were subjected to a single CSD episode. In vivo, extracellular single-unit recording was used to measure meningeal afferent ongoing activity changes. Quantitative mechanical stimuli using a servomotor force-controlled stimulator assessed changes in the afferent's mechanosensitivity. Manipulation of meningeal P2X receptors was achieved via local administration of pharmacological agents. Broad-spectrum P2X receptor inhibition, selective blockade of the P2X7 receptor, and its related Pannexin 1 channel suppressed CSD-evoked afferent mechanical sensitization but did not affect the accompanying afferent activation response. Surprisingly, inhibition of the pronociceptive P2X2/3 receptor did not affect the activation or sensitization of meningeal afferents post-CSD. P2X7 signaling underlying afferent mechanosensitization was localized to the meninges and did not affect CSD susceptibility. We propose that meningeal P2X7 and Pannexin 1 signaling, potentially in meningeal macrophages or neutrophils, mediates the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents, which contributes to migraine pain by exacerbating the headache during normally innocuous physical activities.","Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a key pathophysiological event that underlies visual and sensory auras in migraine.

We measured event-related potentials to investigate at which stages in the visual processing hierarchy these two types of object perception differed from one another.
