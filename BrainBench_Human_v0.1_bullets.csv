The study investigates how the brain's functional architecture manages sensory and mnemonic representations while avoiding interference.
The research used first-person, head-mounted virtual reality and fMRI.
Human participants of both sexes learned immersive, real-world visuospatial environments.
The study manipulated the extent of visuospatial context associated with a scene image in memory across three learning conditions.
Learning conditions ranged from a single FOV to a city street.
Individualized, within-subject fMRI was used to determine brain areas supporting memory of visuospatial context during recall (Experiment 1) and recognition (Experiment 2).
Activity in three patches of cortex was modulated by the amount of known visuospatial context.
These patches were located immediately anterior to the three scene perception areas of high-level visual cortex.
Individual subject analyses showed that the anterior patches corresponded to three functionally defined place memory areas.
These place memory areas selectively respond when visually recalling personally familiar places.
The anterior areas showed activity levels modulated by the amount of visuospatial context.
Multivariate analyses revealed that the anterior areas represented the identity of the specific environment being recalled.
Results suggest a convergence zone for scene perception and memory of local visuospatial context at the anterior edge of high-level visual cortex.","The brain must represent both the current scene and memory of the immediate surrounding environment for fluid engagement with the world.

Inhibitory control alterations often result in prefrontal cortex (PFC) hypoactivations across various drugs of abuse.
The study used a stop-signal fMRI task to map inhibitory control in 41 individuals with heroin use disorder (iHUDs) and 24 matched healthy controls (HCs).
Both groups showed similar stop-signal response time (SSRT), a classic measure of inhibitory control.
iHUDs exhibited impaired target detection sensitivity compared to HCs.
iHUDs showed higher activity in the right anterior PFC (aPFC) and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) during successful versus failed stops.
Higher left dlPFC/supplementary motor area (SMA) activity was associated with faster SSRT specifically in iHUDs.
Higher left aPFC activity correlated with better target sensitivity across all participants.
In iHUDs, higher left SMA activity during inhibitory control was associated with shorter time since last heroin use.
Higher left aPFC activity in iHUDs was associated with higher severity of dependence.
Results revealed higher perceptual sensitivity and hyperactivations in cognitive control regions (aPFC, dlPFC, SMA) during inhibitory control in iHUDs.
These neurobehavioral deficits were associated with task performance and heroin use severity measures.
The identified inhibitory control deficits may contribute to self-control lapses in heroin addiction.
These deficits could serve as targets for prevention and intervention efforts to enhance recovery in heroin addiction."

Study investigates slow wave-spindle coupling dynamics using frontocentral EEG.
Large sample of 340 participants (237 females, 103 males) aged 15-83 years.
Spindles abruptly shift from being driven by slow waves to driving slow waves with age.
Reversal is stronger at higher slow-wave frequencies.
Reversal is stronger at lower slow-wave frequencies.
Reversal begins around midlife (age 40-48 years).
Reversed hierarchy is established between 56-83 years of age.
Coupling strength remains unaffected by age.
In older adults, deteriorating coupling is associated with blood plasma GFAP levels.
GFAP is a marker for astrocyte activation.
Data-driven models suggest decreased sleep time and higher age lead to fewer coupling events.
Fewer coupling events are paralleled by increased astrocyte activation.
Astrocyte activation is associated with a backshift of coupling hierarchy toward a ""younger"" status.
Astrocyte activation is also associated with increased coupling occurrence and strength.
This association potentially suggests compensatory processes.
Changes in coupling hierarchy occur gradually starting at midlife.
There exists a sizable window of opportunity for early interventions.
Early interventions could counteract undesirable trajectories associated with neurodegeneration."

This study aimed to bridge human and animal research by examining the temporal relationship between stimulus envelope and spiking.
The study assessed whether diversity in neurons' AM responses contributes to population representation of speech-like sound envelopes.
Responses from single neurons to vocoded speech stimuli were gathered and compared to sinusoidal AM responses in AC of alert, freely moving Mongolian gerbils of both sexes.
AC neurons displayed stereotyped tuning to AM rate but had heterogeneous temporal dynamics.
Preferred response phases accumulated near the onsets of sinusoidal AM periods for slower rates (<8 Hz).
An over-representation of amplitude edges was observed in population responses to both sinusoidal AM and vocoded speech envelopes.
This encoding bias provided a decoding benefit for vocoded speech stimuli using summed population activity.
Higher frequency modulations required a more sophisticated decoder tracking spiking responses from individual cells.
Results suggest that envelope structure relevant to parsing an acoustic stream could be read-out from a distributed, redundant population code."
